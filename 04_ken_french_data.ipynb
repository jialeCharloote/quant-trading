    "Note, based on the description provided, Ken French's 5x5 portfolios are formed using independent sorts, but with an important nuance:\n",

    "1. The breakpoints (quintiles) for both Operating Profitability and Investment are determined using **NYSE stocks only**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. However, the portfolios themselves include **all stocks** (NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ) that meet the data requirements\n",

    "This methodology means:\n",
    "- The breakpoints are not influenced by the typically smaller AMEX and NASDAQ stocks\n",
    "- When all stocks are sorted into the portfolios using these NYSE-based breakpoints, the resulting portfolios will likely NOT have equal value weights\n",
    "- This is intentional - it helps address issues with microcaps while still including the broader universe of stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "This is different from what you described with median cuts where you might expect equal weights.
